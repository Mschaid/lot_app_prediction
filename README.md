# lot_app_prediction


# A small theoretical project with the concept that an engineering team is developing an app to for users to input a ticket and get a probability of winning compared against previous winning ticket occruances. We have been asked to write the backend functionality of this specific task, the data will be stored within the app, so we only need to write the code after the data has been read and cleaned (using processing above).

* Inside the app, the user inputs six different numbers from 1 to 49.
* Under the hood, the six numbers will come as a Python list and serve as an input to our function.
* The engineering team wants us to write a function that prints:
    the number of times the combination selected occurred in the Canada data set; and
    the probability of winning the big prize in the next drawing with that combination.

* A second feature will allow the user to input the number of different tickets they want to play (without inputting the specific combinations they intend to play). 
* Our input will be see an integer between 1 and 13,983,816 (the maximum number of different tickets).
* The function should print information about the probability of winning the big prize depending on the number of different tickets played.
